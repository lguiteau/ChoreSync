# ChoreSync

ChoreSync is a collaborative web application that helps households assign, track, and complete chores fairly. Users can create or join a household, set chore preferences, receive automated weekly chore assignments, track completion over time, and view a leaderboard and fairness score.

This project functions as an independent version of a full-stack group term project originally built under the name FairShare, utilizing a React + Vite frontend and an Express + Firebase backend.

Features

User Onboarding & Accounts
* Create or join a household via invite code
* Multi-step onboarding flow (chores, preferences, mascot)
* Returning users skip onboarding automatically

Authentication
* Email/password authentication
* Google OAuth via Firebase
* Persistent sessions using cookies

Household & Chore Management
* View roommates and household details
* Stage pending chore templates and promote them into active chores
* Manual chore reassignment

Automated Chore Assignment
* Simple round-robin assignment option
* Optimization-based assignment using a weighted matching approach
* Assignments account for user preferences, recent chore history, and fairness over time
* Small randomized weighting is used to avoid repetitive or deterministic weekly assignments

Chore Lifecycle
* Toggle chore completion
* Transactional Firestore updates for consistency
* Weekly and monthly calendar views
* Visual indicators for overdue chores

Fairness & Leaderboard
* Per-user point tracking
* Gini-coefficient–based fairness score to quantify equity across the household

Tech Stack

Frontend
* React 19 + Vite
* TypeScript / JavaScript
* Tailwind CSS
* Motion (animations)
* Radix UI primitives

Backend
* Node.js + Express (TypeScript)
* Firebase Admin SDK (Firestore)
* dotenv for configuration

Storage
* Firestore collections for users, households, chores, and assignments

Development & Testing
* nodemon + ts-node
* Jest (backend, partial)

Architecture Overview

Frontend
* Single-page application
* App.tsx manages routing, session restoration, and screen orchestration
* Onboarding implemented as a modular, multi-step flow

State Management
* Lightweight UserContext for session and household state
* localStorage used for convenience persistence

Backend API
* Centralized route registration in server.ts
* Route groups include:
  * /api/household/* — household data, templates, assignments
  * /api/chores/* — chore lifecycle and calendar aggregation
  * /api/user/*, /api/session — authentication and session persistence

Consistency & Persistence
* Firestore transactions ensure atomic updates when chores are completed or reassigned
* Chore assignments are generated server-side before being persisted to the database
